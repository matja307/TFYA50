%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Design %%
\section{Design}
The program runs molecular dynamics simulations on several monatomic solids. It uses the Lennard-Jones interaction potential for the interaction between atoms, and the velocity verlet algorithm is used for numerical integration. This section aims to describe in some detail how the program is constructed.

%% Simulation World %%
\subsection{Simulation World}
\label{sec:simulation_world}
The simulation world contains representations of atoms, containing information about position and velocity at a given time, aswell as other nessecery parameters.  All atoms are confined in a section of space, called the bulk, to which is applied periodic boundary conditions to simulate an infinite crystal. The bulk is divided into several smaller regions, called cells, which reduce computation speed. 

\subsubsection{Atoms}
\label{sec:atoms}
The program represents atoms as a c++ class. Class instances have properties defining position and velocity of the atom. Each atom interacts with other atoms with the Lennard-Jones potential as described in section \ref{sec:calculating_physical_properties}. Each simulation time step, for each atom there is calculated an interaction potential. The interaction potential gives atom acceleration which is also saved 

\subsubsection{Cells}
\label{sec:cells}
The space of the bulk is divided into a number of cells, all of which span a volume of space. Each cell keeps track of which atoms at a given instant is inside of the cell. The size of a cell is chosen so that all sides of a cell is larger than the potential cutoff distance. This means that an atom only needs to interact with atoms in the same cell and the cells directly next to it. A two dimensional example of the cell structure is shown in figure \ref{fig:cells}. An atom in cell 28 only has neighbors in the nine cells within the marked border. In three dimensions this means that all cells has 27 neighboring cells (itself included). This structure gives a reduced number of atom interactions, disregarding all atom pairs displaced far enough not to give a contribution to the interaction potential. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figs/cells.png}
\caption{\small Two-dimensional cell structure
\label{fig:cells}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}




\subsubsection{The periodic boundary condition}
\label{sec:the_periodic_boundary_condition}
The program uses periodic boundary conditions at the bulk borders. This means that cells which lie on the border of the bulk are in practice in contact with cells on the other side. In the example of figure \ref{fig:cells} the cell number six will be in contact with cells 53, 54 and 55. This will in extent make it possible to simulate an infinite crystal.

FIGURE

This method is modified when running surfrace simulations, as described in section \ref{sec:surface_simulations}.


\subsubsection{Surface simulations}
\label{sec:surface_simulations}
The program is capable of running surface simulations, where the crystal is infinite in two dimensions and has a finite number of atom layers in the third. The process for this kind of simulation is the same as for the bulk simulations, with the difference that the periodic boundary conditions are turned off in one dimension. This means that atoms at the \emph{top} of the crystal (at the surface) will not interact with atoms at the other side of the crystal. Atoms at the side of the crystal will interact with atoms at the other side just as for bulk simulations.

%% Calculating Physical Properties %%
\subsection{Calculating Physical Properties}
\label{sec:calculating_physical_properties}
%The velocity for an atom is calculated according to equation \ref{eq:velVerlet}

	%%Atomic Movement%%
\subsubsection{Atomic movement}
The movement of an atom is achieved by calculating its position at every timestep due to its previous position, velocity and accelaration as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:newPos}
\mathbf r(t+\Delta t) =\mathbf r(t) + \mathbf v(t)\Delta t + 0.5 \cdot \mathbf a(t) (\Delta t)^2
\end{equation}

To get the velocity, the velocity verlet algorithm is used:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:velVerlet}
\mathbf v(t+\Delta t) = \mathbf v(t) + 0.5\Delta t  \cdot \mathbf a(t+\Delta t) + \mathbf a(t)
\end{equation}

The acceleration is calculated by using the Newton's equation of motion:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:acceleration}
\mathbf F = -m\mathbf a(t),
\end{equation}

where the \(\mathbf F\) is the total force from every neighboring atom within cutoff acting on the atom and the force between two atoms is calculated using the formula
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:force}
\mathbf F(\mathbf r)=\frac{48\epsilon}{r} \left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \frac 1 2 \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right] \mathbf r
\end{equation}

This expression is correlated to the Lennard Jones potential according to following expression:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:force vs pot}
\mathbf F(\mathbf r)=-\nabla \Theta(r)
\end{equation}

Where \( \Theta(r) \) is the Lennard Jones potential. 

	%%Energies%%
\subsubsection{Energies}

Potential energy for the system is 
\begin{equation}
E_{pot}(r)=\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^S \Theta(r_{ij})
\end{equation}
where \(i\) runs over all atoms in the system, \(j\) runs over all neighboring atoms to atom \(i\) and \( \Theta(r)\) is the Lennard Jones potential between two atoms which is given by following expression

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LJ}
\Theta(r)=4 \epsilon \left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right]
\end{equation}
Here, \( \epsilon\) is the maximum well-depth, \( \sigma \) is the effective atomic radius and \( r\) is the distance between the atoms

From the potential energy we get the cohesive energy for the system as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Ecoh}
E_{coh}=\frac{E_{pot}} N
\end{equation}

where \(E_{pot}\) is the value of the potential energy when the system has reached equilibrium. From the potential energy we also get the kinetic energy for the system as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Ekin}
E_{kin}=\frac{1}2 \sum_{i=1}^N mv_i^2
\end{equation}

	%%Other Properties
\subsubsection{Other properties}
To calculate temperature, debye temperature, pressure, mean square displacement, diffusion coefficient, self diffusion coeffient and heat capacity the following formulas are used

Temperature
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:temperature}
T=\frac{2E_{kin}}{3k_b}
\end{equation}
where \(k_b\) is the Boltzmann constant.

Debye Temperature
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:debyetemperature}
\Theta_D^2=\frac{3 \hbar^2T}{mk_b \left< \Delta r^2\right>}
\end{equation}

Pressure
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pressure}
P=\frac{Nk_bT}{V} + \frac 1 {6V} \left[\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j\not=i}^N  \mathbf r_{ij} \cdot \mathbf f_{ij} \right]
\end{equation}
where \(V\) is the volume of the system.

Mean Square Displacement
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:MSD}
\left< \Delta r^2 \right>= \frac 1 N \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ r_i(t_n)-r_i(t_0) \right]^2
\end{equation}
where \( n\) is the number of time steps in the simulation

Diffusion coefficient
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diffCoeff}
D= \int_0^\infty dt \left< v_x(t)v_x(0)\right>
\end{equation}

Self-diffusion coefficient
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:selfDiffCoeff}
2tD=\frac 1 3 \left<|r_i(t)-r_i(t=0)|^2 \right>
\end{equation}

Specific heat
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:specHeat}
\frac{\left< T^2\right> - \left< T \right>^2}{\left< T\right>^2} = \frac 3{2N} \left(1-\frac{3Nk_b}{2C_v} \right) \Rightarrow
C_v =\frac{\frac{3Nk_b} 2}{1-\frac{2N} 3 \frac{\left< T^2\right> - \left< T \right>^2}{\left< T\right>^2}}
\end{equation}

All of theese except the temperature and pressure are calculated only when the system has reached equilibrium.

%% Thermostat%%
\subsection{Thermostat}
\label{sec:thermostat}

The thermostat is implementet as a Woodstock thermostat. %% (inte riktigt men jag vill skriva om den så det blir en sån// Malin)
At every n:th time step, where n is a choosen value for every simulation, the velocity for all atoms are rescaled to force the temperature to be what we want it to be. The scale factor is calculated as the desired temperature devided by the, at the present time step, actual temperature. %%stämmer det?

%% Data %%
\subsection{Data output}
\label{sec:data_output}
The physical properties calculated by the program (as described in section \ref{sec:calculating_physical_properties}) are saved in \texttt{.txt} files. The output format is designed so as to be readable by a \texttt{Matlab} program. These properties can be plotted as functions over simulation time by the Matlab program, as described in section \ref{sec:graphics}. 

The program also has capabilities to save the atom positions for every \emph{n}:th time step. This option is chosen at simulation startup, and can be turned on or off. These values are like the physical properties saved to a text file formatted to be read by a Matlab program. This Matlab program can animate the motion of the atoms during the simulation. 

Details about the plotting and animation programs in Matlab are given in section \ref{sec:graphics}, and usage of the programs are given in appendix A.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Appendix A - User Manual %%
\section*{Appendix A - User Manual}

\label{sec:AppendixA}
When the program is run the user will be asked to input certain parameters in order to start the simulation.

\textbf{Start from an old simulation (Yes/No)}: If an old simulation is availible the user can choose to start a new simulation back to back with the old simulation.  

\textbf{Number of unit cells}: Set the number of unit cells in each cartesian direction. The number of cells in each direction does not have to be the same.

\textbf{Periodic boundary condition in z (Yes/No):} 

\textbf{Time step size:} This determines the time step with which the system progresses. It is given in units of femtoseconds.

\textbf{Number of steps:} Here we choose for how many time steps the simulation will run.

\textbf{Input wanted material:} Choose which material to use in the simulation. The following materials are included in the program and are chosen by inputing their corresponding symbol from the periodic table as follows:

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l | l l}
Li & Lithium & Na & Sodium \\
Ar & Argon & K & Potassium \\
Cr & Chromium & Fe & Iron \\
Mo & Molybdenum & W & Wolfram \\
He & Helium & & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


\textbf{Start temperature:} Give the starting temperature for the system in Kelvin.

\textbf{Scaling of lattice constant: }If desired, the lattice constant can be varied in multiples of the pre-set lattice constant for the given material. 

\textbf{Cut-off multiples of the lattice constant:} Sets the cutoff in terms of the the given lattice constant.

\textbf{Simulate with thermostat (Yes/No):} If the temperature of the system is desired, it can be measured if the thermostat is enabled. 

\textbf{Update frequency for the thermostat: }The frequency with which the temperature is measured. \\
After this the simulation is started and the progress is shown each five time steps. \\
When the simulation ends the user is given the specific heat as well as the choice of running another simulation back to back. One is prompted to answer whether or not the system is in equilibrium and then proceed by giving the number of time steps for the continued simulation. 

\textbf{Visualizing the result of the simulation:} 
In order to make the data output from the simulation more clear to the user a Matlab script is provided with the main program. The data from the simulation is automatically exported to a text file which is read by the Matlab script in order to plot how the material properties vary over the time of the simulation. The Matlab script simply needs to be run as is, and the plots will be generated. The properties plotted are total energy, potential energy, kinetic energy, temperature, pressure, mean square displacement, Debye temperature, diffusion coefficient and the cohesive energy.
